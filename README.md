# house-price-prediction-project
This is a project I got from the last quiz of a python course from DQLab, to predict a house price based on other house prices.
The courses already guide me to write the code i need to write, so i tried to rewrite and customized it with my style of code 
and from what i thought more simple and more easy to do.

## Instalation
run 'python install -r requirements.txt'
