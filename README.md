# house-price-prediction-project
This is a project I got from the last quiz of a python course from DQLab, to predict a house price based on other house prices.
The courses already guide me to write the code i need to write, so i tried to rewrite and customized it with my style of code 
and from what i thought more simple and more easy to do.

## Instalation
run 'python install -r requirements.txt'

## Running the program
Make sure that you already got data of other houses, that has their land and building area, distance from center of the city, and their prices.
The more data it has the better. And put it in a csv file format.
I already got an example of data from DQLab here.
And then put the new data of a house you want to predict there.

For further details of how the program runs, i already put some comments on each function i put on the code, make sure to read all of those!
